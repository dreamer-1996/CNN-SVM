# CNN-SVM
* CNN works as a good feature extractor
* Instead of using dense layer, why not try and use SVM to see how the classification happens. (SVM is a good classifier for both binary and multiclass)
* Just need to add hinge loss and L2 regularizer in the output layer and it will work as SVM
* So, CNN will provide the features and SVM will classify based on it.
